# MyApplication


I perform the following activities on the android application:

1. Created splash screen activity with a progess bar.
2. Design Login and Register Form.
3. Apply validations on EditText and InputFields.
4. After login, it redirects to the home screen.(username=admin, password=1234)

Here are the Screenshots of this application
